Draft: Write Like a Programmer
==============================
Draft is a CLI-enabled *writing system* to keep your work modular, optimize your files for git for version control, and just make writing *fun* again.


Primary Features
----------------
When you're writing something short, a Google Doc or Word file works great.
But get beyond a few thousand words and you end up in scroll-hell (i.e., when just navigating the doc is a chore).

Draft turns that half-finished novel into a clean, plaintext file tree perfect for git.

- ``parse`` any Markdown file into a file tree of Sections, Chapters, Sub-chapters, and Scenes
- ``sequence`` your files and directories to maintain a sequential index
- ``outline`` your project to help plan and fill in gaps
- ``compile`` your Scenes, Sub-Chapters, Chapters, and Sections into a single document once you're ready to publish
- Other features include ``stats`` (word count, etc.), ``trim`` (remove duplicate spaces), and ``split`` (put each sentence on its own line)

Installation
------------

``pip install draft-cli``
