Draft: Write Like a Programmer
==============================

Draft is a CLI-enabled *writing system* to keep your work modular, easily use git for version control, and just make writing *fun* again.

When you're writing something short, a Google Doc or Word file works great. But get beyond a few thousand words and all of a sudden opening that file comes with a sense of dread.

Draft turns that half-finished novel into a clean, plaintext file tree perfect for git.

Primary Features
----------------

- ``parse`` any Markdown file into a file tree of Sections, Chapters, Sub-chapters, and Scenes
- ``sequence`` your files and directories to maintain a sequential index
- ``outline`` of your project to help plan and fill in gaps
- ``compile`` your Scenes, Sub-Chapters, Chapters, and Sections into a single document once you're ready to publish
- Other features include ``stats`` (e.g., get word count), ``trim`` (remove duplicate spaces), and ``split`` (put each sentence on its own line)

Installation
------------

``pip install draft-cli``
